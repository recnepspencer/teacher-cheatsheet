You could have the best material in the world, but if you mumble, avoid eye contact, or speak in a flat tone, it won't land.</p><p>A confident delivery earns attention and trust—without ever being performative.</p><p>Do:</p><ul><li>Make eye contact—especially when asking questions or bearing testimony.</li><li>Use vocal variety: change your speed, volume, and emphasis to match the emotion or energy.</li><li>Pause. Silence between points shows confidence, gives weight, and invites the Spirit.</li><li>Use open body language—don't cross your arms or hide behind the pulpit the whole time.</li></ul><p>Don't:</p><ul><li>Talk like you're reading a script.</li><li>Rush through your points.</li><li>Apologize unnecessarily (you're not wasting their time—you're serving them).</li></ul><p><strong>✅ Why It Matters:</strong> How you carry yourself tells the room how seriously to take what you're saying. Christ taught with both authority and gentleness. Aim for both.</p>"

      "content": "<p><strong>⚙️ Practical Tip:</strong> Slides should support your teaching, not compete with it. When done right, they clarify and enhance. When done wrong, they distract and dull the Spirit. Research shows that when people are reading dense slides and listening at the same time, retention drops sharply. Keep it simple.</p><ul><li>Use minimal text. Slides are visual cues, not a teleprompter. Aim for 5–7 words max per line.</li><li>Fifty 5-word slides are better than five 50-word slides (although 5 slides is better than 50). Small slides keep attention and create flow.</li><li>One idea per slide. Avoid cramming. Your audience needs space to process what matters.</li><li>Never read your slides word-for-word. Speak to the audience, not to the screen. If it's on the slide, you should be adding to it—not repeating it.</li><li>Use visuals intentionally. Images, diagrams, or short quotes should reinforce your point—not serve as decoration.</li><li>Stay consistent. Use the same fonts, alignment, and spacing throughout. Clean design communicates clarity and respect.</li></ul><p><strong>✅ Why It Matters:</strong> A well-designed visual doesn't just make your lesson look better—it helps people focus better. Clean, simple slides let the message breathe and give the Spirit space to work.</p>"

      "title": "4.3 Authority & Authenticity",
      "content": "<p><strong>⚙️ Practical Tip:</strong> People tune in when they trust you. Not when you act like you have all the answers—but when you speak with clarity, confidence, and honesty. That's what real authority looks like. You don't need to be charismatic by nature—just intentional by design.</p><ul><li>Own the room—charisma is learnable. Charisma = warmth + competence. If you're warm but clueless, people will tune out. If you're sharp but cold, people won't connect. But if you show that you care and you know what you're talking about, people will naturally follow your lead. You don't need to be flashy. You just need to show up with purpose and heart.</li><li>Don't fake certainty. It's okay to say, \"I'm not totally sure about this either.\" It builds trust, not weakness. When in doubt, invite the room into your wrestle.</li><li>Be passionate about what you're teaching. If it doesn't matter to you, it won't matter to them. Choose angles you care about—or pray until you do.</li><li>Avoid over-sharing or making it about you. Vulnerability is powerful when it serves the class—not when it becomes a therapy session. Keep it purposeful.</li><li>Stay composed when things go sideways. A calm redirect builds trust faster than scrambling or apologizing. You don't have to impress—just guide.</li></ul><p><strong>✅ Why It Matters:</strong> Christ taught \"as one having authority\" not because He dominated the room—but because He taught truth with clarity, compassion, and conviction. That same balance is available to anyone who prepares with the Spirit and leads with intent.</p>"

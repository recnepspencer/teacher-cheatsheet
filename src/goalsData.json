      "content": "<p><strong>⚙️ Practical Tip:</strong><br/>Don't wander through your lesson without purpose—pick a clear destination first. A good goal changes something specific about how people think, feel, or act by the end.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Good goals pass the \"so what?\" test.</strong><br/>Example: Instead of \"talk about prayer,\" try:<br/><em>\"Help someone who's bored with prayer find a practical way to reconnect.\"</em></li>\n  <li><strong>Make it measurable.</strong><br/>Example: You suspect many class members struggle with excessive screen time. Set a goal to get a few people to openly share their struggles, then lead a discussion on how specific gospel principles can offer real-world solutions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>✅ Spiritual Parallel:</strong><br/>The scriptures often present broad, aspirational goals—\"be perfect,\" \"pray always,\" \"be righteous.\" These give us direction but aren't meant to be copied directly into lesson goals. Avoid vague, \"primary-answer\" lessons. Instead, clearly define what success looks like in real-life terms your class can act on today.</p>"

      "title": "1.2 State the Purpose at the Start",
      "content": "<p><strong>⚙️ Practical Tip:</strong><br/>Open your lesson with a clear, concise statement of your goal. Doing this keeps you from wandering, helps the class stay focused, and ensures the discussion moves meaningfully rather than just covering material. It sets a clear direction for thoughtful engagement.</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong><br/><em>\"Today we'll explore how gratitude can help us overcome discouragement.\"</em></p>\n<p><strong>⚠️ Ditching this step</strong> is like going to the store on Sunday—it should rarely be done.</p>"

      "title": "1.3 Avoid Fluffy Goals",
      "content": "<p><strong>⚙️ Practical Tip:</strong><br/>If your goal can't fail, it's worthless. Soft, feel-good goals like \"having a nice discussion\" or \"feeling the Spirit\" are weak. Real goals have clear outcomes—they change minds, behaviors, or actions. Tie your goal directly to something that can visibly succeed or fail. No fluff, no excuses.</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong><br/><strong>❌ Fluffy:</strong> \"Talk about scripture study.\"<br/><strong>✅ Real:</strong> \"Help class members realize most scripture-study struggles come from poor routines rather than disobedience, then lead a discussion on practical ways to improve daily schedules.\"</p>\n<p><strong>⚠️ Bottom line:</strong><br/>Weak goals make weak lessons. Set goals with teeth—something measurable, specific, and real.</p>"

      "title": "1.4 Test Your Goal",
      "content": "<p><strong>⚙️ Practical Tip:</strong><br/>Always test your goal before finalizing your lesson. If you can't clearly state why you're teaching something or specifically describe what success would look like, refine your goal until you can.</p>\n<p>The <em>Come, Follow Me</em> manual is a reference—not a script. Members ideally have already read it at home. Just because the manual provides easy content doesn't justify reading from it verbatim. Be willing to venture beyond it when needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Example of a clear test:</strong><br/><em>\"By the end of this lesson, several class members will openly identify something specific they've struggled to forgive, and we'll have discussed at least one practical way the gospel can help them move forward.\"</em></p>\n<p><strong>⚠️ Quick check:</strong><br/>If your goal doesn't pass the clarity test, don't teach it—fix it.</p>"

      "title": "1.5 Embrace Failure",
      "content": "<p><strong>⚙️ Practical Tip:</strong><br/>If you never fail to achieve your lesson goals, you're aiming too low. Great teachers—like all successful people—regularly experience failure because they continually push beyond what's easy and comfortable. For instance, the goal in 1.4—getting class members to openly discuss personal struggles with forgiveness—can feel risky. It might result in awkward silence if no one shares.</p>\n<p>But that's exactly why it's a great goal. Failure in these moments isn't embarrassing; it proves you're genuinely striving for growth.</p>\n<p><strong>Remember:</strong><br/>Winners don't avoid failure; they embrace it. Failure proves you're trying something meaningful.</p>\n<p><strong>⚠️ Quick Check:</strong><br/>If it's been a long time since your lesson missed its goal, set higher standards. Celebrate brave attempts rather than easy successes.</p>"

      "content": "<p><strong>⚙️ Practical Tip:</strong> Bad questions don't just stall discussion—they teach people to disengage. They flatten the room, drain momentum, and subtly train your class to give safe, surface-level answers. Worst of all, they make the gospel feel boring and predictable.</p><p>Here's how to spot a sucky question in the wild:</p><ul><li>It invites only one obvious or factual answer. \"What did Nephi do when he was tied up?\" If there's only one right answer, just teach it—it's not a discussion question.</li><li>It lacks personal relevance. \"What did President Benson say in paragraph 3?\" If it doesn't connect to real-life experience, it won't land.</li><li>It avoids ambiguity or complexity. \"Why is it important to be kind?\" You're asking for virtue signaling, not thoughtful reflection.</li><li>It's too broad or vague. \"What stood out to you in the chapter?\" There's no hook. People mentally check out.</li><li>It's secretly a \"What's in my head?\" question. If you already know the answer you want, just say it. Don't make people guess what's in your brain. That's not discussion—it's a pop quiz disguised as participation.<br>❌ \"Why is the Book of Mormon important?\" (expecting someone to say: \"Because it testifies of Christ.\")<br>✅ Just say: \"One reason I believe the Book of Mormon matters is because it testifies of Christ. But for you, what makes it powerful—or hard to connect with?\"</li></ul><p><strong>🔁 Rule of Thumb:</strong> If your question could be answered by a Primary kid or by reading the manual, it's not a real question. If it has only one right answer, it's not a question—it's a statement in disguise. Own it and teach it directly.</p><p><strong>🛑 Spiritual Consequence:</strong> Sucky questions shrink the gospel. They make it feel like a test with right answers instead of a living, breathing invitation to wrestle with God, with truth, and with our real lives.</p>"

      "content": "<p><strong>⚙️ Practical Tip:</strong> Great questions don't just get people talking—they get people thinking. They make people reflect, wrestle, and connect doctrine to their actual lives. And in a ward where most members are young, married, and juggling real stress, your questions should meet them there.</p><p><strong>🧲 1. Tension / Contrast Questions</strong><br>Expose pressure between gospel principles or internal conflicts people actually face.</p><ul><li>❌ Bad: \"Why is faith important?\" \"Why should we be patient in trials?\"</li><li>✅ Good: \"What does it look like to trust God when you're trying to get pregnant and it's not happening?\" \"Can someone be working hard in a marriage but still feel spiritually disconnected? Why?\"</li></ul><p><strong>💡 2. Perspective-Shift Questions</strong><br>Challenge common assumptions, cultural habits, or surface-level interpretations.</p><ul><li>❌ Bad: \"How can we strengthen our testimonies?\" \"What does it mean to follow the prophet?\"</li><li>✅ Good: \"What are subtle ways perfectionism might be weakening your testimony instead of strengthening it?\" \"How would you teach a friend that following the prophet isn't blind obedience?\"</li></ul><p><strong>👀 3. Personal Experience Questions</strong><br>Invite people to speak from their own lives—especially where it's messy, uncertain, or in progress.</p><ul><li>❌ Bad: \"When have you had a spiritual experience?\" \"Who has felt the Spirit during General Conference?\"</li><li>✅ Good: \"What's something you and your spouse have disagreed on spiritually—and how did you work through it?\" \"What's a gospel principle that used to be hard to believe, but now feels personal?\"</li></ul><p><strong>🔄 4. Real-Life Application Questions</strong><br>Gospel in the real world. Work, marriage, exhaustion, stress, screens, sex, callings.</p><ul><li>❌ Bad: \"How can we live the gospel daily?\" \"How do we keep our covenants?\"</li><li>✅ Good: \"How do you balance spiritual goals with the reality of student life, bills, and no sleep?\" \"What does keeping your covenants look like in the middle of marital conflict?\"</li></ul><p><strong>🤔 5. Self-Awareness / Identity Questions</strong><br>Get people to examine their motives, hang-ups, and current spiritual state.</p><ul><li>❌ Bad: \"How can we improve our prayers?\" \"Why is humility important?\"</li><li>✅ Good: \"What fear are you carrying that's been shaping how you pray lately?\" \"In what part of your life do you feel like you're faking spiritual progress just to look the part?\"</li></ul><p><strong>🌍 6. Outward-Focused Questions</strong><br>These questions challenge people to think beyond themselves—how they can support, strengthen, or uplift others. They create space for empathy, leadership, and action.</p><ul><li>❌ Bad: \"How can I keep my covenants better?\" \"How can I avoid judging others?\"</li><li>✅ Good: \"What are ways you can help the people you minister to or work with keep their covenants?\" \"How can we create a culture in our ward where people feel safe to admit they're struggling spiritually?\"</li></ul><p>These questions shift the burden from self-perfection to Christlike service—which is often a more effective route to personal growth anyway.</p><p><strong>✅ Spiritual Parallel:</strong> Christ's questions were never generic. They cut straight to the heart of what people were hiding, avoiding, or hoping for. When we do the same—compassionately, not aggressively—we create space for revelation, connection, and healing.</p>"

      "content": "<p><strong>⚙️ Practical Tip:</strong> Good questions aren't just about what you ask—they're about how you use them. A shallow question followed by a brilliant one at the wrong time still won't land. This section is about pacing, flow, and maximizing impact.</p><p><strong>1. Go Down the Rabbit Hole</strong><br>The best discussions often come from follow-up questions. When someone gives an insightful or personal answer, don't rush to move on—lean into it. Ask a follow-up. Then another. Alternatively, after someone gives an insightful answer, ask the audience to build on or contract what they said.</p><p>Try to go 3–4 layers deep if the class is engaged. Each question builds trust and opens more space for depth.<br>Example:</p><ul><li>\"Why do we sometimes resist repentance?\"</li><li>\"Is that because we don't trust God—or ourselves?\"</li><li>\"How do you rebuild trust in the Atonement when it feels distant?\"</li><li>\"Have you ever experienced that personally?\"</li><li>\"That was an insightful response. Would anyone like to build on it? (Or does anyone have a different perspective?\"</li></ul><p>These layered discussions are where breakthroughs happen—but only if you're paying attention and willing to go off-script.</p><p><strong>2. Reserve Time for Depth</strong><br>You don't need 15 questions in a lesson. You might only need 3–4 good ones to carry the entire hour—especially if they're layered or complex. Let your class know upfront:</p><p>\"We're going to ask a few real questions today. If even one of them turns into something meaningful, that's a win.\"</p><p>Give permission to dig deep. Sometimes the Spirit shows up not by covering everything, but by going all-in on one thing.</p><p>That said—not every question will land. Some will fizzle. So always have a few extra ready in your back pocket. Build for flexibility, not rigidity.</p><p><strong>3. Ask First, Teach After</strong><br>One of the most underused strategies in gospel teaching is to ask the question before you read the scripture. A well-placed question followed by scripture creates tension, curiosity, and focus.</p><p>Instead of: \"Let's read this verse about faith and then talk about it...\" Try: \"What does faith feel like when your life isn't working out?\" Then read the scripture. \"Now let's see what Paul says here…\"</p><p>This approach turns passive listening into active searching—and makes the scripture hit harder.</p><p><strong>✅ Spiritual Parallel:</strong> Christ often set up His teachings with questions before revealing truth. \"Whom say ye that I am?\" wasn't rhetorical—it primed the heart. When we sequence our lessons intentionally, we're not just filling time—we're creating space for the Spirit to teach.</p>"
